- abs: Promising results have been achieved recently in category-level manipulation that generalizes across object instances. Nevertheless, it often requires expensive real-world data collection and manual specification of semantic keypoints for each object category and task. Additionally, coarse keypoint predictions and ignoring intermediate action sequences hinder adoption in complex manipulation tasks beyond pick-and-place. This work proposes a novel, category-level manipulation framework that leverages an object-centric, category-level representation and model-free 6 DoF motion tracking. The canonical object representation is learned solely in simulation and then used to parse a category-level, task trajectory from a single demonstration video. The demonstration is reprojected to a target trajectory tailored to a novel object via the canonical representation. During execution, the manipulation horizon is decomposed into longrange, collision-free motion and last-inch manipulation. For the latter part, a category-level behavior cloning (CatBC) method leverages motion tracking to perform closed-loop control. CatBC follows the target trajectory, projected from the demonstration and anchored to a dynamically selected category-level coordinate frame. The frame is automatically selected along the manipulation horizon by a local attention mechanism. This framework allows to teach different manipulation strategies by solely providing a single demonstration, without complicated manual programming. Extensive experiments demonstrate its efficacy in a range of challenging industrial tasks in highprecision assembly, which involve learning complex, long-horizon policies. The process exhibits robustness against uncertainty due to dynamics as well as generalization across object instances and scene configurations.

- abs: This research project falls in the domain of uniform-shaped object rearrangement in cluttered and confined workspaces such as shelves, where overhand grasps are not possible. As a result, robot-object and object-object interactions occur frequently and have to be avoided so as to successfully complete a rearrangement task. Therefore, it is a harder setup than the widely-researched tabletop ones, where robot-object and object-object interactions can be simplified or even waived.Below is a simulated example of a Motoman SDA10F robot rearranging cylindrical objects in a cluttered and confined space (a cubic workspace with transparent glasses). The robot can only access objects from one side of the workspace and the task is to rearrange all the objects so that the objects with the same color are aligned in the same column (similar to a grocery scenario where commercial products of the same category are rearranged to be aligned after customers randomly drop them somewhere). The robotic physics simulator is Pybullet.

- abs: This research project tackles a challenging object rearrangement problem where top-down grasps are disallowed in confined workspaces such as shelves or fridges. Therefore, the problem is much harder than the tabletop one where top-down grasps simplify robot-object interactions and waive object-object collisions. Therefore, finding the right sequence of pick-and-place actions with which the objects are rearranged is critical to successfully fulfill the task (avoid collisions, fast computation time and fewer buffers/additional actions to use). Finding such a task sequence require expensive computational resource from both motion planning (compute a single pick-and-place action without incurring undesirable collisions and) and task planning (search the right sequence of such pick-and-place actions). This project, built on top of the previous ICRA work, introduces a lazy evaluation framework to tame the combinatorial challenges of confined spaces rearrangement. It achieves significant speed-ups of computing a solution and can scale up to 16 object, outperforming other state-of-art methods in this domain.

- abs: How do we imbue robots with the ability to efficiently manipulate unseen objects and transfer relevant skills based on demonstrations? End-to-end learning methods often fail to generalize to novel objects or unseen configurations. Instead, we focus on the task-specific pose relationship between relevant parts of interacting objects. We conjecture that this relationship is a generalizable notion of a manipulation task that can transfer to new objects in the same category; examples include the relationship between the pose of a pan relative to an oven or the pose of a mug relative to a mug rack. We call this task-specific pose relationship “cross-pose” and provide a mathematical definition of this concept. We propose a vision-based system that learns to estimate the cross-pose between two objects for a given manipulation task using learned cross-object correspondences. The estimated cross-pose is then used to guide a downstream motion planner to manipulate the objects into the desired pose relationship (placing a pan into the oven or the mug onto the mug rack). We demonstrate our method’s capability to generalize to unseen objects, in some cases after training on only 10 demonstrations in the real world. Results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated and real-world experiments across a number of tasks.

- abs: "Orientation estimation is the core to a variety of vision and robotics tasks such as camera and object pose estimation. Deep learning has offered a way
    \ to develop image-based orientation estimators; however, such estimators often require training on a large labeled dataset, which can be time-intensive 
    \ to collect. In this work, we explore whether self-supervised learning from unlabeled data can be used to alleviate this issue. Specifically, we assume 
    \ access to estimates of the relative orientation between neighboring poses, such that can be obtained via a local alignment method. While self-supervised 
    \ learning has been used successfully for translational object keypoints, in this work, we show that naively applying relative supervision to the rotational
    \ group SO(3) will often fail to converge due to the non-convexity of the rotational space. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new algorithm for 
    \ self-supervised orientation estimation which utilizes Modified Rodrigues Parameters to stereographically project the closed manifold of SO(3)
    \ to the open manifold of R3, allowing the optimization to be done in an open Euclidean space. We empirically validate the benefits of the proposed algorithm
    \ for rotational averaging problem in two settings: (1) direct optimization on rotation parameters, and (2) optimization of parameters of a convolutional 
    \ neural network that predicts object orientations from images. In both settings, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is able to converge to a

- abs: Robotic manipulation of cloth has applications ranging from fabrics manufacturing
    to handling blankets and laundry. Cloth manipulation is challenging for robots
    largely due to their high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and severe self-occlusions
    when in folded or crumpled configurations. Prior work on robotic manipulation
    of cloth relies primarily on vision sensors alone, which may pose challenges for
    fine-grained manipulation tasks such as grasping a desired number of cloth layers
    from a stack of cloth. In this paper, we propose to use tactile sensing for cloth
    manipulation; we attach a tactile sensor (ReSkin) to one of the two fingertips
    of a Franka robot and train a classifier to determine whether the robot is grasping
    a specific number of cloth layers. During test-time experiments, the robot uses
    this classifier as part of its policy to grasp one or two cloth layers using tactile
    feedback to determine suitable grasping points. Experimental results over 180
    physical trials suggest that the proposed method outperforms baselines that do
    not use tactile feedback and has a better generalization to unseen fabrics compared
    to methods that use image classifiers.

- abs: Deformable object manipulation has many applications such as cooking and laundry
    folding in our daily lives. Manipulating elastoplastic objects such as dough is
    particularly challenging because dough lacks a compact state representation and
    requires contact-rich interactions. We consider the task of flattening a piece
    of dough into a specific shape from RGB-D images. While the task is seemingly
    intuitive for humans, there exist local optima for common approaches such as naive
    trajectory optimization. We propose a novel trajectory optimizer that optimizes
    through a differentiable "reset" module, transforming a single-stage, fixed-initialization
    trajectory into a multistage, multi-initialization trajectory where all stages
    are optimized jointly. We then train a closed-loop policy on the demonstrations
    generated by our trajectory optimizer. Our policy receives partial point clouds
    as input, allowing ease of transfer from simulation to the real world. We show
    that our policy can perform real-world dough manipulation, flattening a ball of
    dough into a target shape.

- abs: Robotic manipulation of highly deformable cloth presents a promising opportunity
    to assist people with several daily tasks, such as washing dishes; folding laundry;
    or dressing, bathing, and hygiene assistance for individuals with severe motor
    impairments. In this work, we introduce a formulation that enables a collaborative
    robot to perform visual haptic reasoning with cloth -- the act of inferring the
    location and magnitude of applied forces during physical interaction. We present
    two distinct model representations, trained in physics simulation, that enable
    haptic reasoning using only visual and robot kinematic observations. We conducted
    quantitative evaluations of these models in simulation for robot-assisted dressing,
    bathing, and dish washing tasks, and demonstrate that the trained models can generalize
    across different tasks with varying interactions, human body sizes, and object
    shapes.  We also present results with a real-world mobile manipulator, which used
    our simulation-trained models to estimate applied contact forces while performing
    physically assistive tasks with cloth.

    requires access to the full simulator states and can only solve short-horizon,
    single-skill tasks due to local optima. In this work, we propose a novel framework,
    named DiffSkill, that uses a differentiable physics simulator for skill abstraction
    to solve long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations.
    In particular, we first obtain short-horizon skills for using each individual
    tool from a gradient-based optimizer and then learn a neural skill abstractor
    from the demonstration videos; Finally, we plan over the skills to solve the long-horizon
    task. We show the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable
    object manipulation tasks over previous reinforcement learning algorithms and
    the trajectory optimizer.'

- abs: Liquid state estimation is important for robotics tasks such as pouring; however,
    estimating the state of transparent liquids is a challenging problem. We propose
    a novel segmentation pipeline that can segment transparent liquids such as water
    from a static, RGB image without requiring any manual annotations or heating of
    the liquid for training. Instead, we use a generative model that is capable of
    translating images of colored liquids into synthetically generated transparent
    liquid images, trained only on an unpaired dataset of colored and transparent
    liquid images. Segmentation labels of colored liquids are obtained automatically
    using background subtraction. Our experiments show that we are able to accurately
    predict a segmentation mask for transparent liquids without requiring any manual
    annotations. We demonstrate the utility of transparent liquid segmentation in
    a robotic pouring task that controls pouring by perceiving the liquid height in
    a transparent cup. Accompanying video and supplementary materials can be found
    on our project page.

- abs: Real-time object pose estimation is necessary for many robot manipulation algorithms.
    However, state-of-the-art methods for object pose estimation are trained for a
    specific set of objects; these methods thus need to be retrained to estimate the
    pose of each new object, often requiring tens of GPU-days of training for optimal
    performance. In this paper, we propose the OSSID framework, leveraging a slow
    zero-shot pose estimator to self-supervise the training of a fast detection algorithm.
    This fast detector can then be used to filter the input to the pose estimator,
    drastically improving its inference speed. We show that this self-supervised training
    exceeds the performance of existing zero-shot detection methods on two widely
    used object pose estimation and detection datasets, without requiring any human
    annotations. Further, we show that the resulting method for pose estimation has
    a significantly faster inference speed, due to the ability to filter out large
    parts of the image. Thus, our method for self-supervised online learning of a
    detector (trained using pseudo-labels from a slow pose estimator) leads to accurate
    pose estimation at real-time speeds, without requiring human annotations.

- abs: When navigating in urban environments, many of the objects that need to be
    tracked and avoided are heavily occluded. Planning and tracking using these partial
    scans can be challenging. The aim of this work is to learn to complete these partial
    point clouds, giving us a full understanding of the object's geometry using only
    partial observations. Previous methods achieve this with the help of complete,
    ground-truth annotations of the target objects, which are available only for simulated
    datasets. However, such ground truth is unavailable for real-world LiDAR data.
    In this work, we present a self-supervised point cloud completion algorithm, PointPnCNet,
    which is trained only on partial scans without assuming access to complete, ground-truth
    annotations. Our method achieves this via inpainting. We remove a portion of the
    input data and train the network to complete the missing region. As it is difficult
    to determine which regions were occluded in the initial cloud and which were synthetically
    removed, our network learns to complete the full cloud, including the missing
    regions in the initial partial cloud. We show that our method outperforms previous
    unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods on both the synthetic dataset, ShapeNet,
    and real-world LiDAR dataset, Semantic KITTI.

- abs: 3D object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving and other
    robotics applications. However, these detectors usually require training on large
    amounts of annotated data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. Instead,
    we propose leveraging large amounts of unlabeled point cloud videos by semi-supervised
    learning of 3D object detectors via temporal graph neural networks. Our insight
    is that temporal smoothing can create more accurate detection results on unlabeled
    data, and these smoothed detections can then be used to retrain the detector.
    We learn to perform this temporal reasoning with a graph neural network, where
    edges represent the relationship between candidate detections in different time
    frames.

- abs: Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging for robotics due to the complex
    dynamics of the cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation, and self-occlusions.
    In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn a pixel-based dynamics
    model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose to learn a particle-based
    dynamics model from a partial point cloud observation. To overcome the challenges
    of partial observability, we infer which visible points are connected on the underlying
    cloth mesh. We then learn a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph.
    Compared to previous learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive
    bias with its particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth
    physics; it is invariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily
    visualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
    model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in simulation. Furthermore,
    we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we deploy the model trained
    in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model can successfully smooth
    different types of cloth from crumpled configurations. Videos can be found on
    our project website.

- abs: We address the problem of goal-directed cloth manipulation, a challenging task
    due to the deformability of cloth. Our insight is that optical flow, a technique
    normally used for motion estimation in video, can also provide an effective representation
    for corresponding cloth poses across observation and goal images. We introduce
    FabricFlowNet (FFN), a cloth manipulation policy that leverages flow as both an
    input and as an action representation to improve performance. FabricFlowNet also
    elegantly switches between dual-arm and single-arm actions based on the desired
    goal. We show that FabricFlowNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art model-free
    and model-based cloth manipulation policies. We also present real-world experiments
    on a bimanual system, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer. Finally, we
    show that our method generalizes when trained on a single square cloth to other
    cloth shapes, such as T-shirts and rectangular cloths.

- abs: Reinforcement learning (RL) in low-data and risk-sensitive domains requires
    performant and flexible deployment policies that can readily incorporate constraints
    during deployment. One such class of policies are the semi-parametric H-step lookahead
    policies, which select actions using trajectory optimization over a dynamics model
    for a fixed horizon with a terminal value function. In this work, we investigate
    a novel instantiation of H-step lookahead with a learned model and a terminal
    value function learned by a model-free off-policy algorithm, named Learning Off-Policy
    with Online Planning (LOOP). We provide a theoretical analysis of this method,
    suggesting a tradeoff between model errors and value function errors and empirically
    demonstrate this tradeoff to be beneficial in deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore,
    we identify the "Actor Divergence" issue in this framework and propose Actor Regularized
    Control (ARC), a modified trajectory optimization procedure. We evaluate our method
    on a set of robotic tasks for Offline and Online RL and demonstrate improved performance.
    We also show the flexibility of LOOP to incorporate safety constraints during
    deployment with a set of navigation environments. We demonstrate that LOOP is
    a desirable framework for robotics applications based on its strong performance
    in various important RL settings.

- abs: Pose estimation is a basic module in many robot manipulation pipelines. Estimating
    the pose of objects in the environment can be useful for grasping, motion planning,
    or manipulation. However, current state-of-the-art methods for pose estimation
    either rely on large annotated training sets or simulated data. Further, the long
    training times for these methods prohibit quick interaction with novel objects.
    To address these issues, we introduce a novel method for zero-shot object pose
    estimation in clutter. Our approach uses a hypothesis generation and scoring framework,
    with a focus on learning a scoring function that generalizes to objects not used
    for training. We achieve zero-shot generalization by rating hypotheses as a function
    of unordered point differences. We evaluate our method on challenging datasets
    with both textured and untextured objects in cluttered scenes and demonstrate
    that our method significantly outperforms previous methods on this task. We also
    demonstrate how our system can be used by quickly scanning and building a model
    of a novel object, which can immediately be used by our method for pose estimation.
    Our work allows users to estimate the pose of novel objects without requiring
    any retraining.

- abs: Active sensing through the use of Adaptive Depth Sensors is a nascent field,
    with potential in areas such as Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). They
    do however require dynamically driving a laser / light-source to a specific location
    to capture information, with one such class of sensor being the Triangulation
    Light Curtains (LC). In this work, we introduce a novel approach that exploits
    prior depth distributions from RGB cameras to drive a Light Curtain's laser line
    to regions of uncertainty to get new measurements. These measurements are utilized
    such that depth uncertainty is reduced and errors get corrected recursively. We
    show real-world experiments that validate our approach in outdoor and driving
    settings, and demonstrate qualitative and quantitative improvements in depth RMSE
    when RGB cameras are used in tandem with a Light Curtain.

- abs: Safe local motion planning for autonomous driving in dynamic environments requires
    forecasting how the scene evolves. Practical autonomy stacks adopt a semantic
    object-centric representation of a dynamic scene and build object detection, tracking,
    and prediction modules to solve forecasting. However, training these modules comes
    at an enormous human cost of manually annotated objects across frames. In this
    work, we explore future freespace as an alternative representation to support
    motion planning. Our key intuition is that it is important to avoid straying into
    occupied space regardless of what is occupying it. Importantly, computing ground-truth
    future freespace is annotation-free. First, we explore freespace forecasting as
    a self-supervised learning task. We then demonstrate how to use forecasted freespace
    to identify collision-prone plans from off-the-shelf motion planners. Finally,
    we propose future freespace as an additional source of annotation-free supervision.
    We demonstrate how to integrate such supervision into the learning process of
    learning-based planners. Experimental results on nuScenes and CARLA suggest both
    approaches lead to significant reduction in collision rates.

- abs: Manipulating deformable objects has long been a challenge in robotics due to
    its high dimensional state representation and complex dynamics. Recent success
    in deep reinforcement learning provides a promising direction for learning to
    manipulate deformable objects with data driven methods. However, existing reinforcement
    learning benchmarks only cover tasks with direct state observability and simple
    low-dimensional dynamics or with relatively simple image-based environments, such
    as those with rigid objects. In this paper, we present SoftGym, a set of open-source
    simulated benchmarks for manipulating deformable objects, with a standard OpenAI
    Gym API and a Python interface for creating new environments. Our benchmark will
    enable reproducible research in this important area. Further, we evaluate a variety
    of algorithms on these tasks and highlight challenges for reinforcement learning
    algorithms, including dealing with a state representation that has a high intrinsic
    dimensionality and is partially observable. The experiments and analysis indicate
    the strengths and limitations of existing methods in the context of deformable
    object manipulation that can help point the way forward for future methods development.
    Code and videos of the learned policies can be found on our project website.

- abs: The goal of offline reinforcement learning is to learn a policy from a fixed
    dataset, without further interactions with the environment. This setting will
    be an increasingly more important paradigm for real-world applications of reinforcement
    learning such as robotics, in which data collection is slow and potentially dangerous.
    Existing off-policy algorithms have limited performance on static datasets due
    to extrapolation errors from out-of-distribution actions. This leads to the challenge
    of constraining the policy to select actions within the support of the dataset
    during training. We propose to simply learn the Policy in the Latent Action Space
    (PLAS) such that this requirement is naturally satisfied. We evaluate our method
    on continuous control benchmarks in simulation and a deformable object manipulation
    task with a physical robot. We demonstrate that our method provides competitive
    performance consistently across various continuous control tasks and different
    types of datasets, outperforming existing offline reinforcement learning methods
    with explicit constraints.

- abs: 'Visual data in autonomous driving perception, such as camera image and LiDAR
    point cloud, can be interpreted as a mixture of two aspects: semantic feature
    and geometric structure. Semantics come from the appearance and context of objects
    to the sensor, while geometric structure is the actual 3D shape of point clouds.
    Most detectors on LiDAR point clouds focus only on analyzing the geometric structure
    of objects in real 3D space. Unlike previous works, we propose to learn both semantic
    feature and geometric structure via a unified multi-view framework. Our method
    exploits the nature of LiDAR scans -- 2D range images, and applies well-studied
    2D convolutions to extract semantic features. By fusing semantic and geometric
    features, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in all categories
    by a large margin. The methodology of combining semantic and geometric features
    provides a unique perspective of looking at the problems in real-world 3D point
    cloud detection.'

    Furthermore, in many cloth-related tasks like laundry folding and bed making,

- abs: 3D object trackers usually require training on large amounts of annotated data
    that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. Instead, we propose leveraging
    vast unlabeled datasets by self-supervised metric learning of 3D object trackers,
    with a focus on data association. Large scale annotations for unlabeled data are
    cheaply obtained by automatic object detection and association across frames.
    We show how these self-supervised annotations can be used in a principled manner
    to learn point-cloud embeddings that are effective for 3D tracking. We estimate
    and incorporate uncertainty in self-supervised tracking to learn more robust embeddings,
    without needing any labeled data. We design embeddings to differentiate objects
    across frames, and learn them using uncertainty-aware self-supervised training.
    Finally, we demonstrate their ability to perform accurate data association across
    frames, towards effective and accurate 3D tracking.

- abs: 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is an essential component for many applications
    such as autonomous driving and assistive robotics. Recent work on 3D MOT focuses
    on developing accurate systems giving less attention to practical considerations
    such as computational cost and system complexity. In contrast, this work proposes
    a simple real-time 3D MOT system. Our system first obtains 3D detections from
    a LiDAR point cloud. Then, a straightforward combination of a 3D Kalman filter
    and the Hungarian algorithm is used for state estimation and data association.
    Additionally, 3D MOT datasets such as KITTI evaluate MOT methods in the 2D space
    and standardized 3D MOT evaluation tools are missing for a fair comparison of
    3D MOT methods. Therefore, we propose a new 3D MOT evaluation tool along with
    three new metrics to comprehensively evaluate 3D MOT methods. We show that, although
    our system employs a combination of classical MOT modules, we achieve state-of-the-art
    3D MOT performance on two 3D MOT benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes). Surprisingly,
    although our system does not use any 2D data as inputs, we achieve competitive
    performance on the KITTI 2D MOT leaderboard. Our proposed system runs at a rate
    of 207.4 FPS on the KITTI dataset, achieving the fastest speed among all modern
    MOT systems.

- abs: When interacting with highly dynamic environments, scene flow allows autonomous
    systems to reason about the non-rigid motion of multiple independent objects.
    This is of particular interest in the field of autonomous driving, in which many
    cars, people, bicycles, and other objects need to be accurately tracked. Current
    state-of-the-art methods require annotated scene flow data from autonomous driving
    scenes to train scene flow networks with supervised learning. As an alternative,
    we present a method of training scene flow that uses two self-supervised losses,
    based on nearest neighbors and cycle consistency. These self-supervised losses
    allow us to train our method on large unlabeled autonomous driving datasets; the
    resulting method matches current state-of-the-art supervised performance using
    no real world annotations and exceeds state-of-the-art performance when combining
    our self-supervised approach with supervised learning on a smaller labeled dataset.

- abs: State-of-the-art object grasping methods rely on depth sensing to plan robust
    grasps, but commercially available depth sensors fail to detect transparent and
    specular objects. To improve grasping performance on such objects, we introduce
    a method for learning a multi-modal perception model by bootstrapping from an
    existing uni-modal model. This transfer learning approach requires only a pre-existing
    uni-modal grasping model and paired multi-modal image data for training, foregoing
    the need for ground-truth grasp success labels nor real grasp attempts. Our experiments
    demonstrate that our approach is able to reliably grasp transparent and reflective

- abs: Deep learning object detectors often return false positives with very high
    confidence. Although they optimize generic detection performance, such as mean
    average precision (mAP), they are not designed for reliability. For a reliable
    detection system, if a high confidence detection is made, we would want high certainty
    that the object has indeed been detected. To achieve this, we have developed a
    set of verification tests which a proposed detection must pass to be accepted.
    We develop a theoretical framework which proves that, under certain assumptions,
    our verification tests will not accept any false positives. Based on an approximation
    to this framework, we present a practical detection system that can verify, with
    high precision, whether each detection of a machine-learning based object detector
    is correct. We show that these tests can improve the overall accuracy of a base
    detector and that accepted examples are highly likely to be correct. This allows
    the detector to operate in a high precision regime and can thus be used for robotic
    perception systems as a reliable instance detection method.
