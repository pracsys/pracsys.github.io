abstract = {Tensegrity robots, which are composed of rigid compressive elements (rods) and flexible tensile elements (e.g., cables), have a variety of advantages, including flexibility, light weight, and resistance to mechanical impact. Nevertheless, the hybrid soft-rigid nature of these robots also complicates the ability to localize and track their state. This work aims to address what has been recognized as a grand challenge in this domain, i.e., the pose tracking of tensegrity robots through a markerless, vision-based method, as well as novel, onboard sensors that can measure the length of the robot's cables. In particular, an iterative optimization process is proposed to estimate the 6-DoF poses of each rigid element of a tensegrity robot from an RGB-D video as well as endcap distance measurements from the cable sensors. To ensure the pose estimates of rigid elements are physically feasible, i.e., they are not resulting in collisions between rods or with the environment, physical constraints are introduced during the optimization. Real-world experiments are performed with a 3-bar tensegrity robot, which performs locomotion gaits. Given ground truth data from a motion capture system, the proposed method achieves less than 1 cm translation error and 3 degrees rotation error, which significantly outperforms alternatives. At the same time, the approach can provide pose estimates throughout the robot's motion, while motion capture often fails due to occlusions. },

abstract = {Recent work in robotic manipulation focuses on object retrieval in cluttered space under occlusion. Nevertheless, the majority of efforts lack an analysis of conditions for the completeness of the approaches or the methods apply only when objects can be removed from the workspace. This work formulates the general, occlusion-aware manipulation task, and focuses on safe object reconstruction in a confined space with in-place relocation. A framework that ensures safety with completeness guarantees is proposed. Furthermore, an algorithm, which is an instantiation of this framework for monotone instances, is developed and evaluated empirically by comparing against a random and a greedy baseline on randomly generated experiments in simulation. Even for cluttered scenes with realistic objects, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines and maintains a high success rate across experimental conditions. },

abstract = {Promising results have been achieved recently in category-level manipulation that generalizes across object instances. Nevertheless, it often requires expensive real-world data collection and manual specification of semantic keypoints for each object category and task. Additionally, coarse keypoint predictions and ignoring intermediate action sequences hinder adoption in complex manipulation tasks beyond pick-and-place. This work proposes a novel, category-level manipulation framework that leverages an object-centric, category-level representation and model-free 6 DoF motion tracking. The canonical object representation is learned solely in simulation and then used to parse a category-level, task trajectory from a single demonstration video. The demonstration is reprojected to a target trajectory tailored to a novel object via the canonical representation. During execution, the manipulation horizon is decomposed into long range, collision-free motion and last-inch manipulation. For the latter part, a category-level behavior cloning (CatBC) method leverages motion tracking to perform closed-loop control. CatBC follows the target trajectory, projected from the demonstration and anchored to a dynamically selected category-level coordinate frame. The frame is automatically selected along the manipulation horizon by a local attention mechanism. This framework allows to teach different manipulation strategies by solely providing a single demonstration, without complicated manual programming. Extensive experiments demonstrate its efficacy in a range of challenging industrial tasks in high precision assembly, which involve learning complex, long-horizon policies. The process exhibits robustness against uncertainty due to dynamics as well as generalization across object instances and scene configurations. },

abstract = {Understanding the global dynamics of a robot controller, such as identifying attractors and their regions of attraction (RoA), is important for safe deployment and synthesizing more effective hybrid controllers. This paper proposes a topological framework to analyze the global dynamics of robot controllers, even data-driven ones, in an effective and explainable way. It builds a combinatorial representation representing the underlying system's state space and non-linear dynamics, which is summarized in a directed acyclic graph, the Morse graph. The approach only probes the dynamics locally by forward propagating short trajectories over a state-space discretization, which needs to be a Lipschitz-continuous function. The framework is evaluated given either numerical or data-driven controllers for classical robotic benchmarks. It is compared against established analytical and recent machine learning alternatives for estimating the RoAs of such controllers. It is shown to outperform them in accuracy and efficiency. It also provides deeper insights as it describes the global dynamics up to the discretization's resolution. This allows to use the Morse graph to identify how to synthesize controllers to form improved hybrid solutions or how to identify the physical limitations of a robotic system. },

abstract = {Object rearrangement is important for many applications but remains challenging, especially in confined spaces, such as shelves, where objects cannot be accessed from above and they block reachability to each other. Such constraints require many motion planning and collision checking calls, which are computationally expensive. In addition, the arrangement space grows exponentially with the number of objects. To address these issues, this work introduces a lazy evaluation framework with a local monotone solver and a global planner. Monotone instances are those that can be solved by moving each object at most once. A key insight is that reachability constraints at the grasps for objects’ starts and goals can quickly reveal dependencies between objects without having to execute expensive motion planning queries. Given that, the local solver builds lazily a search tree that respects these reachability constraints without verifying that the arm paths are collision free. It only collision checks when a promising solution is found. If a monotone solution is not found, the non-monotone planner loads the lazy search tree and explores ways to move objects to intermediate locations from where monotone solutions to the goal can be found. Results show that the proposed framework can solve difficult instances in confined spaces with up to 16 objects, which state-of-the-art methods fail to solve. It also solves problems faster than alter- natives, when the alternatives find a solution. It also achieves high-quality solutions, i.e., only 1.8 additional actions on av- erage are needed for non-monotone instances.},

abstract = {This work proposes a robotic pipeline for picking and constrained placement of objects without geometric shape priors. Compared to recent efforts developed for similar tasks, where every object was assumed to be novel, the proposed system recognizes previously manipulated objects and performs online model reconstruction and reuse. Over a lifelong manipulation process, the system keeps learning features of objects it has interacted with and updates their reconstructed models. Whenever an instance of a previously manipulated object reappears, the system aims to first recognize it and then register its previously reconstructed model given the current observation. This step greatly reduces object shape uncertainty allowing the system to even reason for parts of objects, which are currently not observable. This also results in better manipulation efficiency as it reduces the need for active perception of the target object during manipulation. To get a reusable reconstructed model, the proposed pipeline adopts: i) TSDF for object representation, and ii) a variant of the standard particle filter algorithm for pose estimation and tracking of the partial object model. Furthermore, an effective way to construct and maintain a dataset of manipulated objects is presented. A sequence of real-world manipulation experiments is performed. They show how future manipulation tasks become more effective and efficient by reusing reconstructed models of previously manipulated objects, which were generated during their prior manipulation, instead of treating objects as novel every time. },

abstract = {Constraining contacts to remain fixed on an object during manipulation limits the potential workspace size, as motion is subject to the hand's kinematic topology. Finger gaiting is one way to alleviate such restraints. It allows contacts to be freely broken and remade so as to operate on different manipulation manifolds. This capability, however, has traditionally been difficult or impossible to practically realize. A finger gaiting system must simultaneously plan for and control forces on the object while maintaining stability during contact switching. This work alleviates the traditional requirement by taking advantage of system compliance, allowing the hand to more easily switch contacts while maintaining a stable grasp. Our method achieves complete SO(3) finger gaiting control of grasped objects against gravity by developing a manipulation planner that operates via orthogonal safe modes of a compliant, underactuated hand absent of tactile sensors or joint encoders. During manipulation, a low-latency 6D pose object tracker provides feedback via vision, allowing the planner to update its plan online so as to adaptively recover from trajectory deviations. The efficacy of this method is showcased by manipulating both convex and non-convex objects on a real robot. Its robustness is evaluated via perturbation rejection and long trajectory goals. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that has autonomously achieved full SO(3) control of objects within-hand via finger gaiting and without a support surface, elucidating a valuable step towards realizing true robot in-hand manipulation capabilities. },

abstract = {Tensegrity robots, composed of rigid rods and flexible cables, are difficult to accurately model and control given the presence of complex dynamics and high number of DoFs. Differentiable physics engines have been recently proposed as a data-driven approach for model identification of such complex robotic systems. These engines are often executed at a high-frequency to achieve accurate simulation. Ground truth trajectories for training differentiable engines, however, are not typically available at such high frequencies due to limitations of real-world sensors. The present work focuses on this frequency mismatch, which impacts the modeling accuracy. We proposed a recurrent structure for a differentiable physics engine of tensegrity robots, which can be trained effectively even with low-frequency trajectories. To train this new recurrent engine in a robust way, this work introduces relative to prior work: (i) a new implicit integration scheme, (ii) a progressive training pipeline, and (iii) a differentiable collision checker. A model of NASA's icosahedron SUPERballBot on MuJoCo is used as the ground truth system to collect training data. Simulated experiments show that once the recurrent differentiable engine has been trained given the low-frequency trajectories from MuJoCo, it is able to match the behavior of MuJoCo's system. The criterion for success is whether a locomotion strategy learned using the differentiable engine can be transferred back to the ground-truth system and result in a similar motion. Notably, the amount of ground truth data needed to train the differentiable engine, such that the policy is transferable to the ground truth system, is 1% of the data needed to train the policy directly on the ground-truth system. },

abstract = {Prehensile object rearrangement in cluttered and confined spaces has broad applications but is also challenging. For instance, rearranging products in a grocery shelf means that the robot cannot directly access all objects and has limited free space. This is harder than tabletop rearrangement where objects are easily accessible with top-down grasps, which simplifies robot-object interactions. This work focuses on problems where such interactions are critical for completing tasks. It proposes a new efficient and complete solver under general constraints for monotone instances, which can be solved by moving each object at most once. The monotone solver reasons about robot-object constraints and uses them to effectively prune the search space. The new monotone solver is integrated with a global planner to solve non-monotone instances with high-quality solutions fast. Furthermore, this work contributes an effective pre-processing tool to significantly speed up online motion planning queries for rearrangement in confined spaces. Experiments further demonstrate that the proposed monotone solver, equipped with the pre-processing tool, results in 57.3% faster computation and 3 times higher success rate than state-of-the-art methods. Similarly, the resulting global planner is computationally more efficient and has a higher success rate, while producing high-quality solutions for non-monotone instances (i.e., only 1.3 additional actions are needed on average). },

Persistent homology enables the automatic identification of connected components of blocking objects in the space without the need for manual input or tuning of parameters. The proposed algorithm uses this information to push groups of cylindrical objects together and aims to minimize the number of pushing actions needed to reach to the target. Simulated experiments in a physics engine using a model of the Baxter robot show that the proposed topology-driven solution is achieving significantly higher success rate in solving such constrained problems relatively to state-of-the-art alternatives from the literature. It manages to keep the number of pushing actions low, is computationally efficient and the resulting decisions and motion appear natural for effectively solving such tasks. },

This allows to automatically learn and fine-tune the unknown friction coefficients on-the-fly, by minimizing a carefully designed loss function using gradient descent. Experiments show that the predicted trajectories are in excellent agreement with their real-world counterparts. Our proposed approach is computationally superior to existing black-box optimization methods, requiring very few real-world samples for accurate trajectory prediction compared to physics-agnostic techniques, such as neural networks. Experiments also demonstrate that the proposed method allows the robot to quickly adapt to changes in the terrain. Our proposed approach combines the data-efficiency of classical analytical models that are derived from first principles, with the flexibility of data-driven methods, which makes it appropriate for low-cost mobile robots. },

abstract = {This work aims to learn how to perform complex robot manipulation tasks that are composed of several, consecutively executed low-level sub-tasks, given as input a few visual demonstrations of the tasks performed by a person. The sub-tasks consist of moving the robot's end-effector until it reaches a sub-goal region in the task space, performing an action, and triggering the next sub-task when a pre-condition is met. Most prior work in this domain has been concerned with learning only low-level tasks, such as hitting a ball or reaching an object and grasping it. This paper describes a new neural network-based framework for learning simultaneously low-level policies as well as high-level policies, such as deciding which object to pick next or where to place it relative to other objects in the scene. A key feature of the proposed approach is that the policies are learned directly from raw videos of task demonstrations, without any manual annotation or post-processing of the data. Empirical results on object manipulation tasks with a robotic arm show that the proposed network can efficiently learn from real visual demonstrations to perform the tasks, and outperforms popular imitation learning algorithms. },

In a given instance, objects may need to be placed at temporary positions ("buffers") to complete the rearrangement, but allocating these buffer locations can be highly challenging in a cluttered environment. To tackle the challenge, a two-step baseline planner is first developed, which generates a primitive plan based on inherent combinatorial constraints induced by start and goal poses of the objects and then selects buffer locations assisted by the primitive plan. We then employ the "lazy" planner in a tree search framework which is further sped up by adapting a novel preprocessing routine.

abstract = {Learning policies in simulation is promising for reducing human effort when training robot controllers. This is especially true for soft robots that are more adaptive and safe but also more difficult to accurately model and control. The sim2real gap is the main barrier to successfully transfer policies from simulation to a real robot. System identification can be applied to reduce this gap but traditional identification methods require a lot of manual tuning. Data-driven alternatives can tune dynamical models directly from data but are often data hungry, which also incorporates human effort in collecting data. This work proposes a data-driven, end-to-end differentiable simulator focused on the exciting but challenging domain of tensegrity robots. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first differentiable physics engine for tensegrity robots that supports cable, contact, and actuation modeling. The aim is to develop a reasonably simplified, data-driven simulation, which can learn approximate dynamics with limited ground truth data. The dynamics must be accurate enough to generate policies that can be transferred back to the ground-truth system. As a first step in this direction, the current work demonstrates sim2sim transfer, where the unknown physical model of MuJoCo acts as a ground truth system. Two different tensegrity robots are used for evaluation and learning of locomotion policies, a 6-bar and a 3-bar tensegrity. The results indicate that only 0.25% of ground truth data are needed to train a policy that works on the ground truth system when the differentiable engine is used for training against training the policy directly on the ground truth system. },

abstract = {Highly constrained manipulation tasks continue to be challenging for autonomous robots as they require high levels of precision, typically less than 1mm, which is often incompatible with what can be achieved by traditional perception systems. This paper demonstrates that the combination of state-of-the-art object tracking with passively adaptive mechanical hardware can be leveraged to complete precision manipulation tasks with tight, industrially-relevant tolerances (0.25mm). The proposed control method closes the loop through vision by tracking the relative 6D pose of objects in the relevant workspace. It adjusts the control reference of both the compliant manipulator and the hand to complete object insertion tasks via within-hand manipulation. Contrary to previous efforts for insertion, our method does not require expensive force sensors, precision manipulators, or time-consuming, online learning, which is data hungry. Instead, this effort leverages mechanical compliance and utilizes an object-agnostic manipulation model of the hand learned offline, off-the-shelf motion planning, and an RGBD-based object tracker trained solely with synthetic data. These features allow the proposed system to easily generalize and transfer to new tasks and environments. This paper describes in detail the system components and showcases its efficacy with extensive experiments involving tight tolerance peg-in-hole insertion tasks of various geometries as well as open-world constrained placement tasks.},

efficiency but introduces new computational challenges. This paper studies the problem structure of object rearrangement using two arms in synchronous, monotone tabletop setups and develops an optimal mixed integer model. It then describes an efficient and scalable algorithm, which first minimizes the cost of object transfers and then of moves between objects. This is motivated by the fact that, asymptotically, object transfers dominate the cost of solutions. Moreover, a lazy strategy minimizes the number of motion planning calls and results in significant speedups.  Theoretical arguments support the benefits of using two arms and indicate that synchronous execution, in which the two arms perform together either transfers or moves, introduces only a small overhead.  Experiments support these claims and show that the scalable method can quickly compute solutions close to the optimal for the considered setup.},

abstract = {Recent progress in robotic manipulation has dealt with the case of no prior object models in the context of relatively simple tasks, such as bin-picking. Existing methods for more constrained problems, however, such as deliberate placement in a tight region, depend more critically on shape information to achieve safe execution. This work introduces a possibilistic object representation for solving constrained placement tasks without shape priors. A perception method is proposed to track and update the object representation during motion execution, which respects physical and geometric constraints. The method operates directly over sensor data, modeling the seen and unseen parts of the object given observations. It results in a dynamically updated conservative representation, which can be used to plan safe manipulation actions. This task-driven perception process is integrated with manipulation task planning architecture for a dual-arm manipulator to discover efficient solutions for the constrained placement task with minimal sensing. The planning process can make use of handoff operations when necessary for safe placement given the conservative representation. The pipeline is evaluated with data from over 240 real-world experiments involving constrained placement of various unknown objects using a dual-arm manipulator. While straightforward pick-sense-and-place architectures frequently fail to solve these problems, the proposed integrated pipeline achieves more than 95% success and faster execution times.},

abstract = {Tracking the 6D pose of objects in video sequences is important for robot manipulation. This task, however, in- troduces multiple challenges: (i) robot manipulation involves significant occlusions; (ii) data and annotations are troublesome and difficult to collect for 6D poses, which complicates machine learning solutions, and (iii) incremental error drift often accu- mulates in long term tracking to necessitate re-initialization of the object’s pose. This work proposes a data-driven opti- mization approach for long-term, 6D pose tracking. It aims to identify the optimal relative pose given the current RGB-D observation and a synthetic image conditioned on the previous best estimate and the object’s model. The key contribution in this context is a novel neural network architecture, which appropriately disentangles the feature encoding to help reduce domain shift, and an effective 3D orientation representation via Lie Algebra. Consequently, even when the network is trained only with synthetic data can work effectively over real images. Comprehensive experiments over benchmarks - existing ones as well as a new dataset with significant occlusions related to object manipulation - show that the proposed approach achieves consistently robust estimates and outperforms alternatives, even though they have been trained with real images. The approach is also the most computationally efficient among the alternatives and achieves a tracking frequency of 90.9Hz.},

abstract = {Picking an item in the presence of other objects can be challenging as it involves occlusions and partial views. Given object models, one approach is to perform object pose estimation and use the most likely candidate pose per object to pick the target without collisions. This approach, however, ignores the uncertainty of the perception process both regarding the target’s and the surrounding objects’ poses. This work proposes first a perception process for 6D pose estimation, which returns a discrete distribution of object poses in a scene. Then, an open-loop planning pipeline is proposed to return safe and effective solutions for moving a robotic arm to pick, which (a) minimizes the probability of collision with the obstructing objects; and (b) maximizes the probability of reaching the target item. The planning framework models the challenge as a stochastic variant of the Minimum Constraint Removal (MCR) problem. The effectiveness of the methodology is verified given both simulated and real data in different scenarios. The experiments demonstrate the importance of considering the uncertainty of the perception process in terms of safe execution. The results also show that the methodology is more effective than conservative MCR approaches, which avoid all possible object poses regardless of the reported uncertainty.},

abstract = {Robot manipulation often depend on some form of pose estimation to represent the state of the world and allow decision making both at the task-level and for motion or grasp planning. Recent progress in deep learning gives hope for a pose estimation solution that could generalize over textured and texture-less objects, objects with or without distinctive shape properties, and under different lighting conditions and clutter scenarios. Nevertheless, it gives rise to a new set of challenges such as the painful task of acquiring large-scale labeled training datasets and of dealing with their stochastic output over unforeseen scenarios that are not captured by the training. This restricts the scalability of such pose estimation solutions in robot manipulation tasks that often deal with a variety of objects and changing environments.

The thesis first describes an automatic data generation and learning framework to address the scalability challenge. Learning is bootstrapped by generating labeled data via physics simulation and rendering. Then it self-improves over time by acquiring and labeling real-world images via a search-based pose estimation process. The thesis proposes algorithms to generate and validate object poses online based on the objects’ geometry and based on the physical consistency of their scene-level interactions. These algorithms provide robustness even when there exists a domain gap between the synthetic training and the real test scenarios. Finally, the thesis proposes a manipulation planning framework that goes beyond model-based pose estimation. By utilizing a dynamic object representation, this integrated perception and manipulation framework can efficiently solve the task of picking unknown objects and placing them in a constrained space.

The algorithms are evaluated over real-world robot manipulation experiments and over large-scale public datasets. The results indicate the usefulness of physical constraints in both the training and the online estimation phase. Moreover, the proposed framework, while only utilizing simulated data can obtain robust estimation in challenging scenarios such as densely-packed bins and clutter where other approaches suffer as a result of large occlusion and ambiguities due to similar looking texture-less surfaces.},

Such problems involve not only coordinating multiple high-DoF arms, but also searching through possible se- quences of actions including object placements, and handoffs. The current work identifies a useful connection between multi-arm rearrangement and recent re- sults in multi-body path planning on graphs with vertex capacity constraints. Solving a synchronized multi-arm rearrangement at a high-level involves rea- soning over a modal graph, where nodes correspond to stable object placements and object transfer states by the arms. Edges of this graph correspond to pick, placement and handoff operations. The objects can be viewed as pebbles moving over this graph, which has capacity constraints. For instance, each arm can carry a single object but placement locations can accumulate many objects. Efficient inte- ger linear programming-based solvers have been proposed for the corresponding pebble problem. The current work proposes a heuristic to guide the task planning process for synchronized multi-arm rearrangement. Results indicate good scala- bility to multiple arms and objects, and an algorithm that can find high-quality solutions fast and exhibiting desirable anytime behavior.},

abstract = {Integrated task and motion planning problems describe a multi-modal state space, which is often abstracted as a set of smooth manifolds that are connected via sets of transitions states. One approach to solving such problems is to sample reachable states in each of the manifolds, while simultaneously sampling transition states. Prior work has shown that in order to achieve asymptotically optimal (AO) solutions for such piecewise-smooth task planning problems, it is sufficient to double the connection radius required for AO sampling-based motion planning. This was shown under the assumption that the transition sets themselves are smooth. The current work builds upon this result and demonstrates that it is sufficient to use the same connection radius as for standard AO motion planning. Furthermore, the current work studies the case that the transition sets are non-smooth boundary points of the valid state space, which is frequently the case in practice, such as when a gripper grasps an object. This paper generalizes the notion of clearance that is typically assumed in motion and task planning to include such individual, potentially non-smooth transition states. It is shown that asymptotic optimality is retained under this generalized regime.},

Our main contribution is an optimality proof for the single-tree version of the algorithm---a variant that was not analyzed before. Our proof only requires a mild and easily-verifiable set of assumptions on the problem and system: Lipschitz-continuity of the cost function and the dynamics. In particular, we prove that for any system satisfying these assumptions, any trajectory having a piecewise-constant control function and positive clearance from the obstacles can be approximated arbitrarily well by a trajectory found by AO-RRT. We also discuss practical aspects of AO-RRT and present experimental comparisons of variants of the algorithm. },

abstract = {Many manipulation tasks, such as placement or within-hand manipulation, require the object’s pose relative to a robot hand. The task is difficult when the hand significantly occludes the object. It is especially hard for adaptive hands, for which it is not easy to detect the finger’s configuration. In addition, RGB-only approaches face issues with texture-less objects or when the hand and the object look similar. This paper presents a depth-based framework, which aims for robust pose estimation and short response times. The approach detects the adaptive hand’s state via efficient parallel search given the highest overlap between the hand’s model and the point cloud. The hand’s point cloud is pruned and robust global registration is performed to generate object pose hypotheses, which are clustered. False hypotheses are pruned via physical reasoning. The remaining poses’ quality is evaluated given agreement with observed data. Extensive evaluation on synthetic and real data demonstrates the accuracy and computational efficiency of the framework when applied on challenging, highly-occluded scenarios for different object types. An ablation study identifies how the framework’s components help in performance. This work also provides a dataset for in-hand 6D object pose esti- mation.

abstract = {This dissertation explores properties of motion planners that build tree data structures in a robottextquoterights state space. Sampling-based tree planners are especially useful for planning for systems with significant dynamics, due to the inherent forward search that is per- formed. This is in contrast to roadmap planners that require a steering local planner in order to make a graph containing multiple possible paths. This dissertation explores a family of motion planners for systems with significant dynamics, where a steering local planner may be computationally expensive or may not exist. These planners fo- cus on providing practical path quality guarantees without prohibitive computational costs. These planners can be considered successors of each other, in that each sub- sequent algorithm addresses some drawback of its predecessor. The first algorithm, Sparse-RRT, addresses a drawback of the RRT method by considering path quality dur- ing the tree construction process. Sparse-RRT is proven to be probabilistically complete under mild conditions for the first time here, albeit with a poor convergence rate. The second algorithm presented, SST, provides probabilistic completeness and asymptotic near-optimality properties that are provable, but at the cost of additional algorithmic overhead. SST is shown to improve the convergence rate compared to Sparse-RRT. The third algorithm, DIRT, incorporates learned lessons from these two algorithms and their shortcomings, incorporates task space heuristics to further improve runtime per- formance, and simplifies the parameters to more user-friendly ones. DIRT is also shown to be probabilistically complete and asymptotically near-optimal. Application areas explored using this family of algorithms include evaluation of distance functions for planning in belief space, manipulation in cluttered environments, and locomotion plan- ning for an icosahedral tensegrity-based rover prototype that requires a physics engine to simulate its motions.},

This work proposes a set of interpretive principles for how a robotic arm can use pointing actions to communicate task information to people by extending existing models from the related literature. These principles are evaluated through studies where English-speaking human subjects view animations of simulated robots instructing pick-and-place tasks. The evaluation distinguishes two classes of pointing actions that arise in pick-and-place tasks: referential pointing (identifying objects) and spatial pointing (identifying locations). The study indicates that human subjects show greater flexibility in interpreting the intent of referential pointing compared to spatial pointing, which needs to be more deliberate. The results also demonstrate the effects of variation in the environment and task context on the interpretation of pointing. The corpus and the experiments described in this work can impact models of context and coordination as well as the effect of common sense reasoning in human-robot interactions.},

abstract = {Many exciting robotic applications require multiple robots with many degrees of freedom, such as manipulators, to coordinate their motion in a shared workspace. Discovering high-quality paths in such scenarios can be achieved, in principle, by exploring the composite space of all robots. Sampling-based planners do so by building a roadmap or a tree data structure in the corresponding configuration space and can achieve asymptotic optimality. The hardness of motion planning, however, renders the explicit construction of such structures in the composite space of multiple robots impractical. This work proposes a scalable solution for such coupled multi-robot problems, which provides desirable path-quality guarantees and is also computationally efficient. In particular, the proposed dRRT* is an informed, asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior sampling-based multi-robot motion planner, dRRT. The prior approach introduced the idea of building roadmaps for each robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures in the composite space. This work identifies the conditions for convergence to optimal paths in multi-robot problems, which the prior method was not achieving.},

The Springer Tracts in Advanced Robotics (STAR) was launched in 2002 with the goal of bringing to the research community the latest advances in the robotics field based on their significance and quality. During the latest fifteen years, the STAR series has featured publication of both monographs and edited collections. Among the latter, the proceedings of thematic symposia devoted to excellence in robotics research, such as ISRR, ISER, FSR, and WAFR, have been regularly included in STAR. 
 
The expansion of our field as well as the emergence of new research areas has motivated us to enlarge the pool of proceedings in the STAR series in the past few years. This has ultimately led to launching a sister series in parallel to STAR. The Springer Proceedings in Advanced Robotics (SPAR) is dedicated to the timely dissemination of the latest research results presented in selected symposia and workshops. 
 
This volume of the SPAR series brings the proceedings of the twelfth edition of the Workshop Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR). WAFR went back to its roots and was held from December 18 to 20, 2016, in San Francisco, California, the same city in which the very first WAFR was held in 1994. 
 
The volume edited by Ken Goldberg, Pieter Abbeel, Kostas Bekris, and Lauren Miller is a collection of 58 contributions spanning a wide range of applications in manufacturing, medicine, distributed robotics, human–robot interaction, intelligent prosthetics, computer animation, computational biology, and many other areas. Validation of algorithms, design concepts, or techniques is the common thread running through this focused collection. 
 
Rich by topics and authoritative contributors, WAFR culminates with this unique reference on the current developments and new directions in the field of algorithmic foundations. A very fine addition to the series!

abstract = {Acquiring a precise model is a challenging task for many important robotic tasks and systems - including in-hand manipulation using underactuated, adaptive hands. Learning stochastic, data-driven models is a promising alternative as they provide not only a way to propagate forward the system dynamics, but also express the uncertainty present in the collected data. Therefore, such models en- able planning in the space of state distributions, i.e., in the belief space. This paper proposes a planning framework that employs stochastic, learned models, which ex- press a distribution of states as a set of particles. The integration achieves anytime behavior in terms of returning paths of increasing quality under constraints for the probability of success to achieve a goal. The focus of this effort is on pushing the efficiency of the overall methodology despite the notorious computational hardness of belief-space planning. Experiments show that the proposed framework enables reaching a desired goal with higher success rate compared to alternatives in sim- ple benchmarks. This work also provides an application to the motivating domain of in-hand manipulation with underactuated, adaptive hands, both in the case of physically-simulated experiments as well as demonstrations with a real hand.},

abstract = {This paper introduces key machine learning operations that allow the 
realization of robust, joint 6D pose estimation of multiple instances 
of objects either densely packed or in unstructured piles from RGB-D 
data. The first objective is to learn semantic and instance-boundary 
detectors without manual labeling. An adversarial training framework 
in conjunction with physics-based simulation is used to achieve 
detectors that behave similarly in synthetic and real data. Given the 
stochastic output of such detectors, candidates for object poses are 
sampled. The second objective is to automatically learn a single score 
for each pose candidate that represents its quality in terms of 
explaining the entire scene via a gradient boosted tree. The proposed 
method uses features derived from surface and boundary alignment 
between the observed scene and the object model placed at hypothesized 
poses. Scene-level, multi-instance pose estimation is then achieved by 
an integer linear programming process that selects hypotheses that 
maximize the sum of the learned individual scores, while respecting 
constraints, such as avoiding collisions. To evaluate this 
method, a dataset of densely packed objects with 
challenging setups for state-of-the-art approaches is 
collected. Experiments on this dataset and a public one show that 
the method significantly outperforms alternatives in terms of 6D 
pose accuracy while trained only with synthetic datasets.},

In this context, tree sampling-based planners have been developed, some of which achieve asymptotic optimality by propagating random controls during each iteration. While desirable for the analysis, random controls result in slow convergence to high quality trajectories in practice. This short position statement first argues that if a kinodynamic planner has access to local maneuvers that appropriately balance an exploitation-exploration trade-off, the plannertextquoterights per iteration performance is significantly improved. Furthermore, this work argues for the integration of modern machine learning frameworks with state-of-the-art, informed and asymptotically optimal kinodynamic planners. The proposed approach involves using using neural networks to infer local maneuvers for a robotic system with dynamics, which properly balance the above exploitation-exploration trade-off.

abstract = {Automation applications are pushing the deployment of many high DoF manipulators in warehouse and manufacturing environments. This has motivated many efforts on optimizing manipulation tasks involving a single arm. Coordinating multiple arms for manipulation, however, introduces additional computational challenges arising from the 
increased DoFs, as well as the combinatorial increase in the available operations that many manipulators can perform, including handoffs between arms. The focus here is on the case of pick-and-place tasks, which require a sequence of handoffs to be executed, so as to achieve computational efficiency, asymptotic optimality and practical anytime performance. The paper leverages recent advances in multi-robot motion planning for high DoF systems to propose a novel multi-modal extension of the dRRT* algorithm. The key insight is that, instead of naively solving a sequence of motion planning problems, it is computationally advantageous to directly explore the composite space of the integrated multi-arm task and motion planning problem, given input sets of possible pick and handoff configurations. Asymptotic optimality guarantees are possible by sampling additional picks and handoffs over time. The evaluation shows that the approach finds initial solutions fast and improves their quality over time. It also succeeds in finding solutions to harder problem instances relative to alternatives and can scale effectively as the number of robots increases.},

This paper aims to learn a stochastic version of such models automatically from data with minimum user effort. The focus is on identifying the dominant, sensible features required to express hand state transitions given quasi-static motions, thereby enabling the learning of a probabilistic transition model from recorded trajectories. Experiments both with Gaussian Processes (GP) and Neural Network models are included for analysis and evaluation. The metric for local GP regression is obtained with a manifold learning approach, known as "Diffusion Maps", to uncover the lower-dimensional subspace in which the data lies and provide a geodesic metric. Results show that using Diffusion Maps with a feature space composed of the object position, actuator angles, and actuator loads, sufficiently expresses the hand-object system "configuration and can provide accurate enough predictions for a relatively long horizon. To the best of the authorstextquoteright knowledge, this is the first learned transition model for such underactuated hands that achieves this level of predictability. Notably, the same feature space implicitly embeds the size of the manipulated object and can generalize to new objects of varying sizes. Furthermore, the learned model can identify states that are on the verge of failure and which should be avoided during manipulation. The usefulness of the model is also demonstrated by integrating it with closed-loop control to successfully and safely complete manipulation tasks.},

Desirable solutions need to be low-cost, easily deployable and controllable, making minimalistic hardware choices desirable. The challenge in designing an effective solution to this problem relates to appropriately integrating multiple components, so as to achieve a robust pipeline that minimizes failure conditions. The current work proposes a complete pipeline for solving such packing tasks, given access only to RGB-D data and a single robot arm with a minimalistic, vacuum-based end-effector. To achieve the desired level of robustness, three key manipulation primitives are identified, which take advantage of the environment and simple operations to successfully pack multiple cubic objects. The overall approach is demonstrated to be robust to execution and perception errors. The impact of each manipulation primitive is evaluated by considering different versions of the proposed pipeline that incrementally introduce reasoning about object poses and corrective manipulation actions.},

For the exposure component, passive and active air samplers and direct-read monitors were placed by the robot to measure VOCs emitted from the paint and later compared to modeled estimates. A strong correlation of R2 = 0.85- 0.89 was found between increased paint used and increased total VOC air concentrations. Similar trends were observed for all painting trials for the direct read monitors with an overall low VOC air concentration (< 4 ppm), indicating a low exposure profile. Consistent results for the front (60.1 textpm 2.5 cm by 77.5 textpm 0.85 cm) and sides (60.1 textpm 2.5 cm by 60.1 textpm 2.9 cm) painted by the robot, the resulting exposure, and the amount of paint used per trial suggest that using a robot to perform an exposure study was successful.

abstract = {Tensegrity robots, which are prototypical examples of hybrid soft-rigid robots, exhibit dynamical properties that provide ruggedness and adaptability. They also bring about, however, major challenges for locomotion control. Due to high dimensionality and the complex evolution of contact states, data-driven approaches are appropriate for producing viable feedback policies for tensegrities. Guided Policy Search (GPS), a sample-efficient hybrid framework for optimization and reinforcement learning, has previously been applied to generate periodic, axis-constrained locomotion by an icosahedral tensegrity on flat ground. Varying environments and tasks, however, create a need for more adaptive and general locomotion control that actively utilizes an expanded space of robot states. This implies significantly higher needs in terms of sample data and setup effort. This work mitigates such requirements by proposing a new GPS- based reinforcement learning pipeline, which exploits the vehicletextquoterights high degree of symmetry and appropriately learns contextual behaviors that are sustainable without periodicity. Newly achieved capabilities include axially-unconstrained rolling, rough terrain traversal, and rough incline ascent. These tasks are evaluated for a small variety of key model parameters in simulation and tested on the NASA hardware prototype, SUPERball. Results confirm the utility of symmetry exploitation and the adaptability of the vehicle. They also shed light on numerous strengths and limitations of the GPS framework for policy design and transfer to real hybrid soft-rigid robots.},

abstract = {Tensegrity-based robots can achieve locomotion through shape deformation and compliance. They are highly adaptable to their surroundings, have light weight, low cost and are physically robust. Their high dimensionality and strongly dynamic nature, however, complicate motion planning. Efforts to-date have primarily considered quasi-static reconfiguration and short-term dynamic motion of tensegrity robots, which do not fully exploit the underlying system dynamics in the long term. Longer-horizon planning has previously required costly search over the full space of valid control inputs. This work synthesizes new and existing approaches to produce dynamic long-term motion while balancing the computational demand. A numerical process based upon quasi-static assumptions is first applied to deform the system into an unstable configuration, causing forward motion. The dynamical characteristics of the result are then altered via a few simple parameters to produce a small but diverse set of useful behaviors. The proposed approach takes advantage of identified symmetries on the prototypical spherical tensegrity robot, which reduce the number of needed gaits but allow motion along different directions. These gaits are first combined with a standard search method to achieve long term planning in environments where the developed gaits are effective. For more complex environments, the various motion primitives are paired with the fall-back option of random valid actions and are used by an informed sampling-based kinodynamic motion planner with anytime properties. Evaluations using a physics-based model for the prototypical robot demonstrate that modest but efficiently-applied search effort can unlock the utility of dynamic tensegrity motion to produce high-quality solutions.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on vision-based pose estimation for multiple rigid objects placed in clutter, especially in cases involving occlusions and objects resting on each other. Progress has been achieved recently in object recognition given advancements in deep learning. Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount of training data and significant manual effort to label objects. This limits their applicability in robotics, where solutions must scale to a large number of objects and variety of conditions. Moreover, the combinatorial nature of the scenes that could arise from the placement of multiple objects is hard to capture in the training dataset. Thus, the learned models might not produce the desired level of precision required for tasks, such as robotic manipulation. This work proposes an autonomous process for pose estimation that spans from data generation, to scene-level reasoning and self-learning. In particular, the proposed framework first generates a labeled dataset for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection in clutter. These detections are used to guide a scene-level optimization process, which considers the interactions between the different objects present in the clutter to output pose estimates of high precision. Furthermore, confident estimates are used to label online real images from multiple views and re-train the process in a self-learning pipeline. Experimental results indicate that this process is quickly able to identify in cluttered scenes physically-consistent object poses that are more precise than the ones found by reasoning over individual instances of objects. Furthermore, the quality of pose estimates increases over time given the self-learning process.},

This is motivated by the fact that asymptotically object transfers dominate the cost of solutions. Moreover, a lazy strategy minimizes the number of motion planning calls and results in significant speedups. Theoretical arguments support the benefits of using two arms and indicate that synchronous operation introduces only a small cost increase.

Such underactuated hands are able to passively achieve stable contacts with objects. Combined with vision-based control and data-driven state estimation process, they can solve tasks without accurate hand-object models or multi-modal sensory feedback. In particular, a data-driven regression process is used here to estimate the probability of dropping the object for given manipulation states. Then, an optimization-based planner aims to track the desired path while avoiding states that are above a threshold probability of dropping the object. The optimized cost function, based on the principle of Dynamic-Time Warping (DTW), seeks to minimize the area between the desired and the followed path. By adapting the threshold for the probability of dropping the object, the framework can handle objects of different weights without retraining. Experiments involving writing letters with a marker, as well as tracing randomized paths, were conducted on the Yale Model T-42 hand. Results indicate that the framework successfully avoids undesirable states, while minimizing the proposed cost function, thereby producing object paths for within-hand manipulation that closely match the target ones.},

abstract = {This paper studies the underlying combinatorial structure of a class of object rearrangement problems, which appear frequently in applications. The problems involve multiple, similar-geometry objects placed on a flat, horizontal surface, where a robot can approach them from above and perform pick-and-place operations to rearrange them. The paper considers both the case where the start and goal object poses overlap, and where they do not. For overlapping poses, the primary objective is to minimize the number of pick-and-place actions and then to minimize the distance traveled by the end-effector. For the non-overlapping case, the objective is solely to minimize the 
travel distance of the end-effector. While such problems do not involve all the complexities of general rearrangement, they remain computationally hard in both cases. This is shown through reductions from well-understood, hard combinatorial challenges to these rearrangement problems. The reductions are also shown to hold in the reverse direction, which enables the convenient application on rearrangement of well studied algorithms. These algorithms can be very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. The paper builds on these reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline for dealing with the rearrangement problems. Experimental evaluation, including hardware-based trials, shows that the proposed pipeline computes high-quality paths with regards to the optimization objectives. Furthermore, it exhibits highly desirable scalability as the number of objects increases in both the overlapping and non-overlapping setup.},

abstract = {This work studies rearrangement problems involving the sorting of robots or objects in stack-like containers, which can be accessed only from one side. Two scenarios are considered: one where every robot or object needs to reach a particular stack, and a setting in which each robot has a distinct position within a stack. In both cases, the goal is to minimize the number of stack removals that need to be performed. Stack rearrangement is shown to be intimately connected to pebble motion problems, a useful abstraction in multi-robot path planning. Through this connection, feasibility of stack rearrangement can be readily addressed. The paper continues to establish lower and upper bounds on optimality, which differ only by a logarithmic factor, in terms of 
stack removals. An algorithmic solution is then developed that produces suboptimal paths much quicker than a pebble motion solver. Furthermore, informed search-based methods are proposed for finding high-quality solutions. The efficiency and desirable scalability of the methods is demonstrated in simulation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a practical approach for identifying unknown mechanical parameters, such as mass and friction models of manipulated rigid objects or actuated robotic links, in a succinct manner that aims to improve the performance of policy search algorithms. Key features of this approach are the use of off-the-shelf physics engines and the adaptation of a black-box Bayesian optimization framework for this purpose. The physics engine is used to reproduce in simulation experiments that are performed on a real robot, and the mechanical parameters of the simulated system are automatically fine-tuned so that the simulated trajectories match with the real ones. The optimized model is then used for learning a policy in simulation, before safely deploying it on the real robot. Given the well-known limitations of physics engines in modeling real-world objects, it is generally not possible to find a mechanical model that reproduces in simulation the real trajectories exactly. Moreover, there are many scenarios where a near-optimal policy can be found without having a perfect knowledge of the system. Therefore, searching for a perfect model may not be worth the computational effort in practice. The proposed approach aims then to identify a model that is good enough to approximate the value of a locally optimal policy with a certain confidence, instead of spending all the computational resources on searching for the most accurate model. Empirical evaluations, performed in simulation and on a real robotic manipulation task, show that model identification via physics engines can significantly boost the performance of policy search algorithms that are popular in robotics, such as TRPO, PoWER and PILCO, with no additional real-world data.},

These vehicles, however, undergo complex contact dynamics that prevent the use of traditional control techniques based on mathematical analyses of equations of motion. Data-driven approaches are thus an appropriate choice for controller design, but are themselves hindered by the high number of degrees of freedom and correspondingly large state spaces. 
 
This paper presents a scheme for exploiting the 24th-order symmetry of an icosahedral tensegrity robot to vastly reduce the breadth of the controller input space without loss of information. Symmetric properties and state reduction operations are detailed and placed in the context of a data-driven control pipeline. Results are illustrated by comparing the input and output of a locomotive controller in both raw and symmetry-reduced dynamical spaces. The findings suggest a strong relief of the data requirements for training locomotive controllers.},

Classic control and planning methods achieve such coverage through the synthesis of model-based components.

In these setups, derived models frequently fail to express important real-world subtleties. An increasingly popular approach to deal with this issue corresponds to end-to-end machine learning architectures, which adapt to such complexities through a data-driven process.

Their high dimensionality and highly dynamic nature, however, complicate motion planning. So far, only rudimentary quasi-static solutions have been achieved, which do not utilize tensegrity dynamics. This work explores a spectrum of planning methods that increasingly allow dynamic motion for such platforms. Symmetries are first identified for a prototypical spherical tensegrity robot, which reduce the number of needed gaits. Then, a numerical process is proposed for generating quasi-static gaits that move forward the systemtextquoterights center of mass in different directions. These gaits are combined with a search method to achieve a quasi-static solution. In complex environments, however, this approach is not able to fully explore the space and utilize dynamics. This motivates the application of sampling-based, kinodynamic planners. This paper proposes such a method for tensegrity locomotion that is informed and has anytime properties. The proposed solution allows the generation of dynamic motion and provides good quality solutions. Evaluation using a physics-based model for the prototypical robot highlight the benefits of the proposed scheme and the limits of quasi-static solutions.},

The paper describes the conditions for convergence to optimal paths in multi-robot problems. Moreover, simulated experiments indicate dRRT* converges to high-quality paths and scales to higher numbers of robots where various alternatives fail.

To explore this, we build a scaled remote driving prototype and conduct a controlled human study with varying network delays based on current commercial LTE network. Our study demonstrates that remote driving over LTE is not immediately feasible, primarily caused by the variability of the network delay instead of its magnitude. In addition, our findings also indicate that the negative effect of remote driving over LTE can be mitigated by a video frame arrangement strategy that trades off the magnitude of delay in order to achieve smoother display.},

Nevertheless, such tools typically require a large amount of training data and significant manual effort for labeling objects. This limits their applicability in robotics, where it is necessary to scale solutions to a large number of objects and a variety of conditions. The present work proposes a fully autonomous process to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) for object detection and pose estimation in robotic setups. The application involves detection of objects placed in a clutter and in tight environments, such as a shelf. In particular, given access to 3D object models, several aspects of the environment are simulated and the models are placed in physically realistic poses with respect to their environment to generate a labeled synthetic dataset. To further improve object detection, the network self-trains over real images that are labeled using a robust multi-view pose estimation process. The proposed training process is evaluated on several existing datasets and on a dataset that we collected with a Motoman robotic manipulator. Results show that the proposed process outperforms popular training processes relying on synthetic data generation and manual annotation.},

This frequently happens in manipulation planning, where it may be desirable to identify the minimum set of movable obstacles to be cleared to manipulate a target object. This is a similar objective to that of the Minimum Constraint Removal problem, which, however, does not exhibit dynamic programming properties, i.e., subsets of optimum solutions are not necessarily optimal. Thus, searching for MCR paths is computationally expensive. Motivated by this challenge and related work, this paper investigates approximations for computing MCR paths in the context of manipulation planning. The proposed framework searches for MCR paths up to a certain length of solution in terms of end-effector distance. This length can be defined as a multiple of the shortest path length in the space when movable objects are ignored. Given experimental evaluation on simulated manipulation planning challenges, the bounded-length approximation provides a desirable tradeoff between minimizing constraints, computational cost and path length.},

abstract = {This paper studies the underlying combinatorial structure of a class of object rearrangement problems that appear frequently in applications. This class considers multiple, similar-geometry objects placed on a flat, horizontal surface, where a robot can approach them with overhand grasps and perform pick-and-place operations to rearrange them. The paper considers both the case where the start and goal object poses overlap, and where they do not. For overlapping poses, the primary objective is to minimize the number of pick-and-place actions and then to minimize the distance traveled by the end-effector. For the non-overlapping case, the objective is solely to minimize the end-effector distance. While this class of problems does not involve all the complexities of general rearrangement, it remains a computationally hard challenge for both cases. This is shown by reducing well understood combinatorial challenges that are hard to these rearrangement problems. The benefit of this reduction is that there are well studied algorithms for solving the combinatorial challenges. These algorithms can be very efficient in practice despite the hardness results. The paper builds on top of these reduction results to propose an algorithmic pipeline for dealing with the rearrangement problem. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed pipeline achieves high-quality paths in terms of the optimization objective(s) and exhibits highly desirable scalability as the number of objects increases in both overlapping and non-overlapping setups.},

abstract = {Manipulating movable obstacles is a hard problem that involves searching high-dimensional configuration spaces. A milestone method for this problem by Stilman et al. was able to compute solutions for monotone instances. These are problems where every object needs to be transferred at most once to achieve a desired arrangement of all objects. The method uses backtracking search to find the order with which objects should be moved in the environment. This paper first proposes an approximate but significantly faster alternative for monotone rearrangement instances. The method defines a dependency graph between objects given the minimum constraint removal paths (Minimum Constraint Removal) to transfer each object to its target. From this graph it is possible to discover the order of moving the objects by performing topological sorting without the need for backtracking search. The approximation arises from the limitation to consider only the Minimum Constraint Removal paths for moving the objects. Such paths, however, minimize the number of conflicts between the objects. To solve non-monotone instances, this primitive is incorporated in a higher-level incremental search algorithm for general rearrangement planning, that operates similar to Bi-RRT. Given a start and a goal arrangement of objects, tree structures of reachable new arrangements are generated by using the primitive as an expansion procedure. The integrated solution achieves probabilistic completeness for the general non-monotone case and based on simulated experiments it achieves very good success ratios, solution times and path quality relative to all the alternatives considered.},

abstract = {Sampling-based algorithms are viewed as practical solutions for high-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of random geometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved with these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of the underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical, to generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots or physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was even possible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems without access to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes how to achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incremental sampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two new methods, Stable Sparse-RRT (SST) and SST*, result from this analysis, which are asymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shown to converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse set of samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance of the planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systems benchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots.},

abstract = {An important logistics application of robotics involves manipulators that pick-and-place objects placed in warehouse shelves. A critical aspect of this task corresponds to detecting the pose of a known object in the shelf using visual data. Solving this problem can be assisted by the use of an RGB-D sensor, which also provides depth information beyond visual data. Nevertheless, it remains a challenging problem since multiple issues need to be addressed, such as low illumination inside shelves, clutter, texture-less and reflective objects as well as the limitations of depth sensors. This paper provides a new rich data set for advancing the state-of-the-art in RGBD-based 3D object pose estimation, which is focused on the challenges that arise when solving warehouse pick-and-place tasks. The publicly available data set includes thousands of images and corresponding ground truth data for the objects used during the first Amazon Picking Challenge at different poses and clutter conditions. Each image is accompanied with ground truth information to assist in the evaluation of algorithms for object detection. To show the utility of the data set, a recent algorithm for RGBD-based pose estimation is evaluated in this paper. Based on the measured performance of the algorithm on the data set, various modifications and improvements are applied to increase the accuracy of detection. These steps can be easily applied to a variety of different methodologies for object pose detection and improve performance in the domain of warehouse pick-and-place.},

abstract = {Many methods for planning under uncertainty operate in the belief space, i.e., the set of distributions over states. Although the problem is computationally hard, recent advances have shown that belief-space planning is becoming practical for many medium size problems. Some of the most successful methods utilize sampling and often rely on distances between beliefs to partially guide the search process. This paper deals with the question of what is a suitable distance function for belief space planning, which despite its importance remains unanswered. This work indicates that the rarely used Wasserstein distance (also known as Earth Movertextquoterights Distance (EMD)) is a more suitable metric than the commonly used L1 and Kullback-Leibler (KL) for belief-space planning. Simulation results on Non-Observable Markov Decision Problems, i.e., the simplest class of belief-space planning, indicate that as the problem becomes more complex, the differences on the ef- fectiveness of different distance functions become quite prominent. In fact, in state spaces with more than 4 dimensions, by just replacing L1 or KL distance with EMD, the problems become from virtually unsolvable to solvable within a reasonable time frame. Furthermore, preliminary results on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes indicate that point-based solvers with EMD use a smaller number of samples to generate policies with similar qualities, compared to those with L1 and KL. This paper also shows that EMD caries the Lipschitz continuity of the cost of the states to Lipschitz continuity of the expected cost of the beliefs. Such a continuity property is often critical for convergence to optimal solutions.},

abstract = {An important skill for robots is the effective rearrangement of multiple objects so as to deal with clutter in human spaces. This paper proposes a simple but general primitive for rearranging multiple objects and its use in task planning frameworks. Rearrangement is a challenging problem as it involves combinatorially large, continuous C-spaces for multiple movable bodies and with kinematic constraints. This work starts by reviewing an existing search-based approach, which quickly computes solutions for monotone challenges, i.e., when objects need to be grasped only once so as to be rearranged. This work focuses on non-monotone challenges, as well as labeled problems, which some of the related efforts do not address. The first contribution is the extension of the monotone solution to a method that addresses a subset of non-monotone challenges. Then, this work proposes the use of the resulting non-monotone solver as a local planner in the context of a higher-level task planner that searches the space of object placements and for which stronger guarantees can be provided. The paper aims to emphasize the benefit of using more powerful motion primitives in the context of task planning for object rearrangement. Experiments in simulation using a model of a Baxter robot arm show the capability of solving difficult instances of rearrangement problems and evaluate the methods in terms of success ratio, computational requirements, scalability and path quality.},

existence of constraints, such as obstacles. In these cases, the 
minimum constraint removal problem asks for the minimum set of 
constraints that need to be removed from the state space to find a 
solution. For instance, in manipulation planning, it is desirable to 
compute the minimum set of obstacles to be cleared from the workspace 
to manipulate a target object. Unfortunately, minimum constraint 
removal paths do not exhibit dynamic programming properties, i.e., 
subsets of optimum solutions are not necessarily optimal. Thus, 
searching for such solutions is computationally expensive. This leads 
to approximate methods, which balance the cost of computing a solution 
and its quality. This work investigates alternatives in this context 
and evaluates their performance in terms of such tradeoffs. Solutions 
that follow a bounded-length approach, i.e., searching for paths up to 
a certain length, seem to provide a good balance between minimizing

computation of paths between any two vertices of the original graph

path degradation of graph spanners is significantly smaller than the 
theoretical bound; even so, expected path degradation of graph 
spanners is typically not studied. This work is inspired by this 
observation and focuses on grid path-finding to propose an algorithm 
that constructs a grid spanner. Theoretical analysis for the obstacle 
free case shows that significant performance gains can be achieved 
with a small decrease in expected path quality. This is an important 
first step towards studying the expected performance of

The method takes advantage of feedback from the human user, who confirms the presence of landmarks, something that users with visual impairments already do when navigating in a building. The system calculates the usertextquoterights location in real time and uses it to provide audio instructions on how to reach the desired destination.

abstract = {Asymptotically optimal planners, such as PRM*, guarantee that solutions approach optimal as the number of iterations increases. Roadmaps with this property, however, may grow too large for storing on resource-constrained robots and for achieving efficient online query resolution. By relaxing optimality, asymptotically near-optimal planners produce sparser graphs by not including all edges. The idea 
stems from graph spanners, which produce sparse subgraphs that guarantee near-optimality. Existing asymptotically optimal and near-optimal planners, however, include all sampled configurations as roadmap nodes, meaning only infinite-size graphs have the desired properties. To address this limitation, this work describes SPARS, an algorithm that returns a sparse roadmap spanner. The method provides the following properties: (a) probabilistic completeness, (b) asymptotic near-optimality and (c) the probability of adding nodes to the spanner converges to zero as iterations increase. The last point suggests that finite-size data structures with asymptotic near-optimality in continuous spaces may indeed exist. The approach builds simultaneously a dense graph similar to PRM* and its 
roadmap spanner, meaning that upon construction an infinite-size graph is still needed asymptotically. An extension of SPARS is also presented, termed SPARS-2, which removes the dependency on building a dense graph for constructing the sparse roadmap spanner and for which it is shown that the same desirable properties hold. 
Simulations for rigid body motion planning show that algorithms for constructing sparse roadmap spanners indeed provide small data structures and result in faster query resolution. The rate of node addition is shown to decrease over time and practically the quality of solutions is considerably better than the theoretical bounds. Upon construction, the memory requirements of SPARS-2 are significantly 
smaller but there is a small sacrifice in the size of the final spanner relative to SPARS.},

Early work focused on quickly returning feasible solutions. Only recently was it shown under which conditions algorithms, such as PRM*, return optimal solutions in an asymptotic sense or near-optimal for the recently proposed roadmap spanners. Still, all these methods yield desired properties in an asymptotic fashion, meaning the properties are only truly attained after infinite amount of computation time. This work studies the finite-time properties of sampling-based algorithms in turns of path quality. The focus is on planners that construct roadmaps, as it is more straightforward to reason for these techniques. This paper argues that existing sampling-based planners, which construct roadmaps in an asymptotically optimal or near-optimal manner, exhibit a probably near-optimal property in finite time. This means that it is possible to compute a confidence value, i.e., a probability, regarding the existence of upper bounds for the length of the path returned by the roadmap as a function of the number of configuration space samples. This property can result in useful tools for determining existence of solutions and a probabilistic stopping criterion for prm -like methods.

abstract = {Roadmap spanners have been proposed as a way to acquire sparse data structures that can efficiently answer path queries in continuous spaces with probabilistic completeness and asymptotic near-optimality guarantees. The current construction method, named SPARS, provides these properties by constructing in parallel a relatively dense asymptotically-optimal roadmap based on PRM*. This feature limits the methodtextquoterights benefits. This paper shows that it is possible to relax the conditions under which a sample is added to the spanner and provide the desired properties, while not requiring the use of a dense graph. A key aspect of SPARS is that the probability of adding nodes to the roadmap goes to zero over increasing iterations, which is maintained in the proposed extension. The paper describes the new algorithm, argues its theoretical properties and evaluates it against PRM* and the original SPARS algorithm. The experimental results suggest that the memory requirements of the method upon construction are dramatically reduced, while it returns competitive quality paths for the same construction time with PRM*. There is a small sacrifice in the size of the final spanner relative to SPARS but the new method still returns graphs orders of magnitudes smaller than PRM*, leading to very efficient online query resolution.},

abstract = {Asymptotically optimal motion planners guarantee that solutions approach optimal as more iterations are performed. A recently proposed roadmap-based method, the PRM* approach, provides this desirable property and minimizes the computational cost of generating the roadmap. Even for this method, however, the roadmap can be slow to construct and quickly grows too large for storage or fast online query resolution, especially for relatively high-dimensional instances. In graph theory there are algorithms that produce sparse subgraphs, known as graph spanners, which guarantee near-optimal paths. This work proposes different alternatives for interleaving graph spanners with the asymptotically optimal PRM* algorithm. The first alternative follows a sequential approach, where a graph spanner algorithm is applied on the output roadmap of PRM*. The second one is an incremental method, where during the construction of the roadmap, certain edges are not considered as they are not necessary for the construction of a roadmap spanner. The result in both cases is an asymptotically near-optimal motion planning solution. Theoretical analysis and experiments performed on typical, geometric motion planning instances show that large reductions in construction time, roadmap density, and online query resolution time can be achieved with a small sacrifice of path quality through roadmap spanners.},

abstract = {Multi-agent pathfinding is a challenging combinatorial search problem that involves multiple agents moving on a graph from a set of initial nodes to a set of desired goals without inter-agent collisions. Searching the composite space of all agents has exponential complexity in the number of agents and does not scale well. Decoupled methods are more efficient but are generally incomplete. A recent development is the introduction of polynomial time algorithms utilizing single-agent primitives that provide completeness guarantees for a large class of problem instances on general graphs. One limitation of these alternatives is that the resulting solution is sequential, where only one agent moves at a time. Such solutions are of low quality when compared to methods where multiple agents can move simultaneously. Motivated by these recent developments, this paper proposes an algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding that utilizes similar single-agent primitives but allows all agents to move in parallel. The paper describes the algorithm and its desirable properties. Experimental comparisons suggest that the resulting solutions are considerably better than sequential ones, even after a post-processing parallelization step, as well as solutions returned by decoupled and coupled alternatives. The experiments also suggest excellent scalability and competitive computational performance.},

abstract = {Many multi-agent applications may involve a notion of spatial coherence. For in- stance, simulations of virtual agents often need to model a coherent group or crowd. Alternatively, robots may prefer to stay within a pre-specified communication range. This work proposes an extension of a decentralized, reactive collision avoidance frame- work, which defines obstacles in the velocity space, known as Velocity Obstacles (VOs), for coherent groups of agents. The extension, referred to in this work as a Loss of Communication Obstacle (LOCO), aims to maintain proximity among agents by imposing constraints in the velocity space and restricting the set of feasible controls. If the introduction of LOCOs results in a problem that is too restrictive, then the proximity constraints are relaxed in order to maintain collision avoidance. A weighted velocity selection scheme is utilized in order to steer agents towards their goals, as well as agents which are farther away and thus might be violating proximity constraints. The approach is fast and integrates nicely with the Velocity Obstacle framework. It is shown to yield improved coherence for groups of robots connected through an input constraint graph, while moving with constant velocity. The approach is evaluated for collisions, computational cost and proximity constraint maintenance through a series of simulated environments, which have single and multiple team variations. The experiments show that improved coherence is achieved while maintaining collision avoidance, at a small computational cost and path quality degradation. 
 
 
In order to experimentally validate new algorithms, such as the LOCO approach, having a software infrastructure capable of running a plethora of algorithms on many agents is needed. When moving from virtual agents to robotic systems, these algorithms take the form of a controller. Composing various controllers together to create a diverse testbed environment is also essential for the development process of new algorithms.

This work de- scribes a system able to guide people with VI through buildings using inexpensive sensors, such as accelerometers, which are available in portable devices like smart phones. The method takes advantage of feedback from the human user, who confirms the presence of landmarks. The system calculates the usertextquoterights location in real time and uses it to provide audio instructions on how to reach the desired destination. Previous work suggested that the accuracy of the approach depended on the type of directions and the availability of an appropriate transition model for the user. A critical parameter for the transition model is the usertextquoterights step length. The current work investigates different schemes for automatically computing the usertextquoterights step length and reducing the dependency of the approach to the definition of an accurate transition model. Furthermore, the direction provision method is able to use the localization estimate and adapt to failed executions of paths by the users. Experiments are presented that evaluate the accuracy of the overall integrated system, which is executed online on a smart phone. Both people with visual impairments, as well as blindfolded sighted people, participated in the experiments.

The method introduces a multi-level graph, which can be constructed offline. Each level corresponds to a different formation and edges between levels allow for formation transitions. All edges satisfy curvature bounds and clearance requirements from obstacles. During the online phase, the method returns a path for a virtual leader, as well as the points along the path where the team should switch formations. Individual agents can compute their controls using kinematic formation controllers that operate in curvilinear coordinates. The approach guarantees that it is feasible for the agents to follow the trajectory returned. Simulations show that the online cost of the approach is small.

If the robots have to respect second-order dynamics, this becomes a challenging problem, even for static environments. This work presents a replanning framework where each robot computes partial plans during each cycle, while executing a previously computed trajectory. Each robot communicates with its neighbors to select a trajectory that is safe over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach does not require synchronization and allows the robots to dynamically change their cycles over time. This paper proves that the proposed motion coordination algorithm guarantees safety under this general setting. This framework is not specific to the underlying robot dynamics, as it can be used with a variety of dynamical systems, nor to the planning or control algorithm used to generate the robot trajectories. The performance of the approach is evaluated using a distributed multi-robot simulator on a computing cluster, where the simulated robots are forced to communicate by exchanging messages. The simulation results confirm the safety of the algorithm in various environments with up to 32 robots governed by second-order dynamics.},

By augmenting the Generalized Roundabout Policy (GRP), which guarantees collision avoidance, this paper improves the performance and liveness characteristics for such problems. These gains are achieved by integrating a second hybrid policy with GRP that updates the desired direction for each vehicle based on a dynamic priority scheme. In this scheme, minimalistic communication between vehicles is employed, such that information is periodically exchanged when changes in the high-level operating mode or prioritization occur. This information exchange is taking place only locally and data are exchanged only between neighboring vehicles. Additionally, each agent selects a control using only this local information and rules established by the two underlying hybrid automata. The proposed technique scales well due to its decentralized nature; the computational complexity depends on the maximum number of vehicles in communication range for a vehicle. This paper presents simulations which show that the proposed approach can solve problems faster than using GRP alone, as well as solve instances in which GRP fails to find a solution, with minimal communication and computational overhead.},

The results are favorable for the proposed algorithm and show that the technique scales to problems that require high levels of coordination, involving hundreds of agents.},

Such desirable properties, however, depend on the availability of an appropriate metric, which is often difficult to be defined for important robotic systems, such as non-holonomic and underactuated ones. This paper investigates a general methodology to approximate optimum cost-to-go metrics by employing an offline learning phase in obstacle-free environments. The proposed method utilizes sampling to construct a dense graph that approximates the connectivity properties of the state space. This graph can be employed online to compute approximate distances between states using nearest neighbor queries and standard search algorithms, such as A*. Unfortunately, this process significantly increases the online cost of a sampling-based planner. The paper proceeds into investigating ways that allow the computationally efficient utilization of the learned metric during the plannertextquoterights online operation. One idea considered is the mapping of the sampled states into a higher-dimensional Euclidean space through multi-dimensional scaling so as to retain the relative distances represented by the sampled graph. Proof of concept simulations on a first-order car and on an illustrative example of an asymmetric state space, indicate that the approach has merit and can lead into more effective sampling-based algorithms.},

This problem appears in a variety of applications, including planetary exploration, warehouse management, intelligent transportation networks, assembly and disassembly, autonomous robotic mining, as well as computer games. Unfortunately, computing the optimal set of paths is NP-complete, making a naive search computationally prohibitive. Typical methods to solve this problem either consider the full composite robot, which guarantees optimality and completeness but suffers from exponential complexity, or decoupled approaches which compute very fast solutions by considering each robot individually, but suffer from deadlocks. The complexity versus completeness tradeoff makes efficient coupled and decoupled solutions highly desirable, depending on the problem domain. This work presents three novel techniques for effectively solving multi-robot path planning instances. Thefirst is related to intelligent transportation networks, and utilizes a distributed sensor network to compute and re-plan paths in a decoupled manner for hundreds of robots in real-time. The second algorithm is a centralized method that provides completeness for a sub-class of multi-robot problems by removing dependencies between robots using intermediate goals, and quickly solves the problem using a sequence of single robot paths. The third technique, also centralized, is complete for a more general class of problems, and employs sequential "push" and "swap" primitives to solve instances faster than state-of-the-art coupled and decoupled approaches. </div>},

The focus of this work is on improving the performance and liveness features for such problems. Towards this objective, a new hybrid policy that updates the desired direction for each vehicle based on a dynamic priority scheme is proposed.

This work describes a system able to guide people with VI through buildings using inexpensive sensors, such as accelerometers, which are available in portable devices like smart phones. This ap- proach introduces some challenges due to the limited computational power of the portable devices and the highly erroneous sensors. The method takes advantage of feedback from the human user, who confirms the presence of landmarks. The system calculates the location of the user in real time and uses it to provide audio instructions on how to reach the desired destination. A first set of experiments suggested that the accuracy of the localization depends on the type of directions provided and the availability of good transition and observation models that describe the usertextquoterights behav- ior. During this initial set of experiments, the system was not executed in real time so the approach had to be improved. Towards an improved version of the method, a significant amount of computation was transferred offline in order to speed up the systemtextquoterights online execution. Inspired by results in multi-model estimation, this work employs multiple particle filters, where each one uses a different assumption for the usertextquoterights average step length. This helps to adaptively estimate the value of this pa- rameter on the fly. The system simultaneously estimates the step length of the user, as it varies between different people, from path to path, and during the execution of the path. Experiments are presented that evaluate the accuracy of the location estimation process and of the integrated direction provision method. Sighted people, that were blindfolded, participated in these experiments.},

abstract = {As robots become more versatile, they are increasingly found to operate together in the same environment where they must coordinate their motion in a distributed manner. Such operation does not present problems if the motion is quasi-static and collisions can be easily avoided. However, when the robots follow second-order dynamics, the problem becomes challenging even for a known environment. The setup in this work considers that each robot replans its own trajectory for the next replanning cycle. The planning process must guarantee the robottextquoterights safety by ensuring collision-free paths for the considered period and by not bringing the robot to states where collisions cannot be avoided in the future. This problem can be addressed through communication among the robots, but it becomes complicated when the replanning cycles of the different robots are not synchronized and the robots make planning decisions at different time instants. This paper shows how to guarantee the safe operation of multiple communicating second-order vehicles, whose replanning cycles do not coincide, through an asynchronous, distributed motion planning framework. The method is evaluated through simulations, where each robot is simulated on a different processor and communicates with its neighbors through message passing. The simulations confirm that the approach provides safety in scenarios with up to 48 robots with second-order dynamics in environments with obstacles, where collisions occur often without a safety framework.},

abstract = {Motion planning is a fundamental algorithmic problem that attracts attention because of its importance in many exciting applications, such as controlling robots or virtual agents in simulations and computer games. While there has been great progress over the last decades in solving high-dimensional geometric problems there are still many challenges that limit the capabilities of existing solutions. In particular, it is important to effectively model and plan for systems with complex dynamics and significant drift (kinodynamic planning). An additional requirement is that realistic systems and agents must safely operate in a real-time fashion (replanning), with partial knowledge of their surroundings (partial observability) and despite the presence or in collaboration with other moving agents (distributed planning). This thesis describes techniques that address challenges related to real-time motion planning while focusing on systems with non-trivial dynamics. The first contribution is a new kinodynamic planner, termed Informed Subdivision Tree (IST), that incorporates heuristics to solve motion planning queries more effectively while achieving the theoretical guarantee of probabilistic completeness. The thesis proposes also a general methodology to construct heuristics for kinodynamic planning based on configuration space knowledge through a roadmap-based approach. Then this thesis investigates replanning problems, where a planner is called periodically given a predefined amount of time. In this scenario, safety concerns arise by the presence of both dynamic motion constraints and time limitations. The thesis proposes the framework of Short-Term Safety Replanning (STSR), which achieves safety guarantees in this context while minimizing computational overhead. The final contribution corresponds to an extension of the STSR framework in distributed planning, where multiple agents communicate to safely avoid collisions despite their dynamic constraints. The proposed algorithms are tested on simulated systems with interesting dynamics, including physically simulated systems. Such experiments correspond to the state-of-the-art in terms of system modeling for motion planning. The experiments show that the proposed techniques outperform existing alternatives, where available, and emphasize their computational advantages.},

abstract = {Sampling-based search has been shown effective in motion planning, a hard continuous state-space problem. Motion planning is especially challenging when the robotic system obeys differential constraints, such as an acceleration controlled car that cannot move sideways. Methods that expand trajectory trees in the state space produce feasible solutions for such systems. These planners can be viewed as continuous-space analogs of traditional uninformed search as their goal is to explore the entire state space. In many cases, the search can be focused on the part of the state-space necessary to solve a problem by employing heuristics. This paper proposes an informed framework for tree-based planning that successfully balances greedy with methodical search. The framework allows the use of a broad set of heuristics for goal-directed problem solving, while avoiding scaling issues that appear in continuous space heuristic search. It also employs an appropriate discretization technique for continuous state-space problems, based on an adaptive subdivision scheme. Although greedy in nature, the method provides with probabilistic completeness guarantees for a very general class of planning problems. Experiments on dynamic systems simulated with a physics engine show that the technique outperforms uninformed planners and existing informed variants. In many cases, it also produces better quality paths.},

abstract = {The success of sampling-based motion planners has resulted in a plethora of methods for improving planning components, such as sampling and connection strategies, local planners and collision checking primitives. Although this rapid progress indicates the importance of the motion planning problem and the maturity of the field, it also makes the evaluation of new methods time consuming. We propose that a systems approach is needed for the development and the experimental validation of new motion planners and/or components in existing motion planners. In this paper, we present the Online, Open-source, Programming System for Motion Planning (OOPSMP), a programming infrastructure that provides implementations of various existing algorithms in a modular, object-oriented fashion that is easily extendible. The system is open-source, since a community-based effort better facilitates the development of a common infrastructure and is less prone to errors. We hope that researchers will contribute their optimized implementations of their methods and thus improve the quality of the code available for use. A dynamic web interface and a dynamic linking architecture at the programming level allows users to easily add new planning components, algorithms, benchmarks, and experiment with different parameters. The system allows the direct comparison of new contributions with existing approaches on the same hardware and programming infrastructure.},

abstract = {An important milestone for building affordable robots that can become widely popular is to address robustly the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem with inexpensive, off-the-shelf sensors, such as monocular cameras. These sensors, however, impose significant challenges on SLAM procedures because they provide only bearing data related to environmental landmarks. This paper starts by providing an extensive comparison of different techniques for bearing-only SLAM in terms of robustness under different noise models, landmark densities and robot paths. We have experimented in a simulated environment with a variety of existing online algorithms including Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPFs). Our experiments suggest that RB-PFs are more robust compared to other existing methods and run considerably faster. Nevertheless, their performance suffers in the presence of outliers. In order to overcome this limitation we proceed to propose an augmentation of RB-PFs with: (a) Gaussian Sum Filters for landmark initialization and (b) an online, unsupervised outlier rejection policy. This framework exhibits impressive robustness and efficiency even in the presence of outliers.},

abstract = {Omni-directional vision allows for the development of techniques for mobile robot navigation that have minimum perceptual requirements. In this work, we focus on robot navigation algorithms that do not require range information or metric maps of the environment. More specifically, we present a homing strategy that enables a robot to return to its home position after executing a long path. The proposed strategy relies on measuring the angle between pairs of features extracted from panoramic images, which can be achieved accurately and robustly. In the heart of the proposed homing strategy lies a novel, local control law that enables a robot to reach any position on the plane by exploiting the bearings of at least three landmarks of unknown position, without making assumptions regarding the robottextquoterights orientation and without making use of a compass. This control law is the result of the unification of two other local control laws which guide the robot by monitoring the bearing of landmarks and which are able to reach complementary sets of goal positions on the plane. Long-range homing is then realized through the systematic application of the unified control law between automatically extracted milestone positions connecting the robottextquoterights current position to the home position. Experimental results, conducted both in a simulated environment and on a robotic platform equipped with a panoramic camera validate the employed local control laws as well as the overall homing strategy. Moreover, they show that panoramic vision can assist in simplifying the perceptual processes required to support robust and accurate homing behaviors.},

abstract = {We propose a novel, vision-based method for robot homing, the problem of computing a route so that a robot can return to its initial textquotedbllefthometextquotedblright position after the execution of an arbitrary textquotedblleftpriortextquotedblright path. The method assumes that the robot tracks visual features in panoramic views of the environment that it acquires as it moves. By exploiting only angular information regarding the tracked features, a local control strategy moves the robot between two positions, provided that there are at least three features that can be matched in the panoramas acquired at these positions. The strategy is successful when certain geometric constraints on the configuration of the two positions relative to the features are fulfilled. In order to achieve long-range homing, the featurestextquoteright trajectories are organized in a visual memory during the execution of the textquotedblleftpriortextquotedblright path. When homing is initiated, the robot selects Milestone Positions (MPs) on the textquotedblleftpriortextquotedblright path by exploiting information in its visual memory. The MP selection process aims at picking positions that guarantee the success of the local control strategy between two consecutive MPs. The sequence of successive MPs successfully guides the robot even if the visual context in the textquotedbllefthometextquotedblright position is radically different from the visual context at the position where homing was initiated. Experimental results from a prototype implementation of the method demonstrate that homing can be achieved with high accuracy, independent of the distance traveled by the robot. The contribution of this work is that it shows how a complex navigational task such as homing can be accomplished efficiently, robustly and in real-time by exploiting primitive visual cues. Such cues carry implicit information regarding the 3D structure of the environment. Thus, the computation of explicit range information and the existence of a geometric map are not required.},

This article describes the design, implementation and analysis of a system for determining position inside a building from measured RF signal strengths of packets on an IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet network. Previous approaches to location-awareness with RF signals have been severely hampered by non-Gaussian signals, noise, and complex correlations due to multi-path effects, interference and absorption. The design of our system begins with the observation that determining position from complex, noisy and non-Gaussian signals is a well studied problem in the field of robotics. Using only off-the-shelf hardware, we achieve robust position estimation to within a meter in our experimental context and after adequate training of our system. We can also coarsely determine our orientation and can track our position as we move. Our results show that we can localize a stationary device to within 1.5 meters over 80% of the time and track a moving device to within 1 meter over 50% of the time. Both localization and tracking run in real-time. By applying recent advances in probabilistic inference of position and sensor fusion from noisy signals, we show that the RF emissions from base stations as measured by off-the-shelf wireless Ethernet cards are sufficiently rich in information to permit a mobile device to reliably track its location.},

abstract = {We propose the combination of techniques that solve multiple queries for motion planning problems with single query planners in a motion planning framework that can be efficiently parallelized. In multiple query motion planning, a data structure is built during a preprocessing phase in order to quickly respond to on-line queries. Alternatively, in single query planning, there is no preprocessing phase and all computations occur during query resolution. This paper shows how to effectively combine a powerful sample-based method primarily designed for multiple query planning (the Probabilistic Roadmap Method - PRM) with sample-based tree methods that were primarily designed for single query planning (such as Expansive Space Trees, Rapidly Exploring Random Trees, and others). Our planner, which we call the Probabilistic Roadmap of Trees (PRT), uses a tree algorithm as a subroutine for PRM. The nodes of the PRM roadmap are now trees. We take advantage of the very powerful sampling schemes of recent tree planners to populate our roadmaps. The combined sampling scheme is in the spirit of the non-uniform sampling and refinement techniques employed in earlier work on PRM. PRT not only achieves a smooth spectrum between multiple query and single query planning but it combines advantages of both. We present experiments which show that PRT is capable of solving problems that cannot be addressed efficiently with PRM or single-query planners.

Odometry has traditionally been used for the implementation of such a behavior, but it has been shown to be an unreliable source of information. In this work, a novel method for visual homing is proposed, based on a panoramic camera. As the robot departs from its initial position, it tracks characteristic features of the environment (corners). As soon as homing is activated, the robot selects intermediate target positions on the original path. These intermediate positions (IPs) are then visited sequentially, until the home position is reached. For the robot to move between two consecutive IPs, it is only required to establish correspondence among at least three corners. This correspondence is obtained through a feature tracking mechanism. The proposed homing scheme is based on the extraction of very low-level sensory information, namely the bearing angles of corners, and has been implemented on a robotic platform. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves homing with a remarkable accuracy, which is not affected by the distance traveled by the robot.},
